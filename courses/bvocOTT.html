              undergraduate degree leading to a B.Voc in Operation Theatre
              Technology equips professionals to manage surgical procedures
              deftly.' clinical specimens. Students who complete this program
              will have the knowledge and abilities necessary to operate in a
              clinical laboratory, where they will conduct various tests to
              identify and cure disorders. Nurses, anesthesiologists,
              specialists, and surgeons are among the target audiences for the
